Summary: This is Weight Tracker Android App. It can be used to set the Target Weight goal and then you can enter the daily weights. And when the weight is reached it will send the notificaiton. It will also display helpful tips regarding exercise, food and eating habits. 

The screen has nice dashboard which displays a line graph with daily weight. At the top it display the current weight and target weight. it has two button to enter the target weight and daily weight. 

The UI design had login / sign up screen and it has nice and easy navigation. 

I used lot of Log.d() log messages and tested on App emulator. 

This was my first Mobile app development. The Zybooks helped a lot.
